## 🌱 About Me

I find unexpected connections in code and life. 

As a Full Stack Developer at Automattic, I help power the 40% of the web that runs on WordPress. But my path here wasn't linear, and that's exactly what makes my approach unique.

After more than 8 years as a digital nomad across 42 countries, I've learned that the best solutions come from connecting seemingly unrelated dots.

**What I bring to code:**
- 🧠 Systems thinking shaped by software, psychology, nature and permaculture *(yes, fungal networks help teach me about APIs)*
- ♿ Accessibility-first development informed by neurodivergent perspectives  
- 🛠️ Real-world problem-solving from years of making things work with limited resources
- 🌍 A deep belief that technology should connect and empower, not divide

**Currently fascinated by:**
- 🍄 How natural systems can inspire better code architecture
- 🔗 **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for everything: blogging, WordPress, front-end development *(because context changes everything)*
- 🧩 Making the web more accessible for minds that think differently
- 💡 Finding the Freakonomics-style surprising connections in tech
